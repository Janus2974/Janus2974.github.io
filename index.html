        <h1>10 Reasons You Should Visit Mexico
        </h1>
    <p>
    Mexico is one of the year’s hottest destinations,
        what with its secret island escapes,
        Caribbean coastline and cosmopolitan capital city
        , as well as its thriving restaurant scene and quirky
        colonial towns that are ideal for day trips.
        However, if you’re still undecided on why exactly
        you should stop by this often-misrepresented North American country,
        here are ten reasons that might convince you exactly why you should visit Mexico.

    <h3>
    The cuisine is amazing and varied
    </h3>
    <p>
    Mexico is a country of delicious food,
        that much is clear, but it’s not all tacos and tortas.
        In fact, the culinary scene from north to south varies wildly,
        although each dish remains just as delicious as the last.
        Whether you want carne asada or cabrito in the north,
        seafood on the Pacific coast in Sinaloa,
        hangover busting tortas ahogadas in western Jalisco or Mayan delicacies in the Yucatán Peninsula,
        one thing’s for sure – you’ll never be short of options.
