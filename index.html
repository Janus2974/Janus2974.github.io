        <p>The <em>spider</em><strong>is awesome because it has senses so extraordinary that we can never even be able to <em>comprehend them</em>
        </strong>.<br>
        such as<br>
        <ul>
            <li>it has microscopic hair on it's legs that dig into the space sbetween materials such as cement which allows them to climb</li>
            <li>it has other hairs on it's body that allow it to sense the tiniest vibration through air i.e someone hitting them with a chapal</li>
        </ul>
